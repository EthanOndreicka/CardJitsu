# Text-Based CardJitsu

This progran is based on Club Penguin's card game called "CardJitsu",
I've been trying to roughly recreate it as a text-based game in Java

# Plans

(1) Implement all original CardJitsu card's into this program

(2) Let the user have the ability to do 1v1 battle versus a friend on the same computer /
    Let the user have the ability to do a 1v1 battle versus a "cpu" that randomly chooses from a list of cards

(3) Implement "power" cards that have certain features

# Current Number of CardJitsu Cards
There are currently 41 of 509 cards useable

# To-do list
- Manage to implement power cards
- Make "cpu" use power card if has (might work)
- Don't allow card duplicates
- Add more cards
